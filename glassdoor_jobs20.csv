We're a respectful, diverse, and dynamic environment in which Engineering is a first-class citizen, and where you'll be able to work on a variety of interesting problems that affect the lives of real people.
We offer a generous budget for personal development expenses like training courses, conferences, and books.
You'll get three weeks' paid vacation and a flexible work policy that is remote- and family-friendly (about 50% of our engineering team is fully remote). We worry about results, not time spent in seats.
What We'll Like About You:
You have 4+ years of experience as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst in a similarly-sized organization, with a proven record of analysis and research that positively impacts your team.
You possess excellent communication skills and the ability to clearly communicate technical concepts to a non-technical audience
You possess excellent SQL/relational algebra skills, ideally with at least a basic knowledge of how different types of databases (e.g.: column vs row storage) work.
You have a superior knowledge of statistical analysis methods, such as input selection, logistic and standard regression, etc.
You are comfortable writing Python code, and have good working knowledge of pandas and numpy. We don't expect you to write production-quality code, but you should have some programming experience.
